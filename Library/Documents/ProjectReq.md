**Case Study: Community Library Membership & Book Lending System**

Build a **.NET Core Console Application** using **EF Core and PostgreSQL** for managing a small community library.

Do **not** start coding immediately. First, plan entities, relationships, business rules, and database design. Create the model classes, design and interactions using interface.

---

**Case Study Requirement**

A community library wants a console-based application to manage:

- Members
- Books
- Book categories
- Book copies
- Borrowing
- Returns
- Fine calculation
- Membership limits

The system should use **PostgreSQL** as the database and **EF Core** for database access.

---

**Core Functional Requirements**

**1. Member Management**

The system should allow:

- Add a new member
- View all members
- Search member by phone number or email
- Update membership status
- Deactivate a member

Each member should have a membership type such as:

- Basic
- Premium
- Student

---

**2. Book Management**

The system should allow:

- Add a new book
- Add multiple copies of a book
- View available books
- Search books by title, author, or category
- Mark a book copy as damaged or unavailable

---

**3. Borrowing Rules**

The system must apply business logic before allowing a member to borrow a book.

**Business Logic Criteria**

|**Membership Type**|**Maximum Active Borrowings**|**Maximum Borrow Days**|
|---|---|---|
|Basic|2 books|7 days|
|Student|3 books|10 days|
|Premium|5 books|15 days|

A member cannot borrow a book if:

- Their membership is inactive
- They already reached the borrowing limit
- The book copy is not available
- They have unpaid fines above ₹500
- They already borrowed the same book and have not returned it

---

**4. Return Rules**

When a book is returned:

- The system should calculate late return fine
- Fine amount = ₹10 per delayed day
- The returned book copy should become available again
- Borrowing status should change to returned
- Return date should be saved

---

**5. Fine Management**

The system should allow:

- View pending fines of a member
- Pay fine
- View fine history
- Prevent borrowing if unpaid fine is above ₹500

---

**Stored Procedure / PostgreSQL Function Requirement**

Participants must create at least **one PostgreSQL function** and call it from EF Core.

Suggested functions:

1. calculate_member_fine(member_id)

- Returns total unpaid fine for a member

3. get_available_books_by_category(category_id)

- Returns available books under a category

5. get_member_borrowing_summary(member_id)

- Returns active borrowed books, returned books, and total fine

---

**Transaction Requirement**

Participants must use **EF Core transaction** for the borrowing process.

Borrowing a book should happen as one transaction:

1. Validate member
2. Validate unpaid fine
3. Check active borrowing count
4. Check book copy availability
5. Create borrowing record
6. Update book copy status as borrowed
7. Commit transaction

If any step fails, rollback the transaction.

---

**Suggested Console Menu**

1. Member Management

2. Book Management

3. Borrow Book

4. Return Book

5. Fine Management

6. Reports

7. Exit

---

**Reports**

Add report options such as:

- Books currently borrowed
- Overdue books
- Members with pending fines
- Most borrowed books
- Available books by category
- Member borrowing history

---

**Plan**

**Requirement Analysis & Design**

Participants should identify:

- Entities
- Relationships
- Business rules
- Required tables
- Primary keys and foreign keys

No coding in this stage.

---

**Project Setup**

Tasks:

- Create .NET Core console app
- Install EF Core packages
- Configure PostgreSQL connection
- Create DbContext
- Configure migrations

---

**Entity and Database Design**

Participants create model classes based on their design.

Expected entities may include:

- Member
- Book
- BookCategory
- BookCopy
- Borrowing
- FinePayment

---

**CRUD Operations**

Implement:

- Add member
- Add book
- Add book copy
- View/search member
- View/search books

---

**Borrowing Logic with Transaction**

Implement the full borrowing workflow using EF Core transaction.

This is the main business logic section.

---

**Return and Fine Calculation**

Implement:

- Return book
- Calculate delay
- Create/update fine
- Mark book copy as available

---

**PostgreSQL Function**

Create and call one PostgreSQL function from EF Core.

Recommended: total unpaid fine by member.

---

**Reports**

Implement useful console reports.

---

**Validation and Exception Handling**

Add validations for:

- Invalid member
- Invalid book
- No available copy
- Fine limit exceeded
- Borrowing limit exceeded
- Duplicate active borrowing

---

**Testing and Demo**

Participants should test:

- Borrowing with different membership types
- Returning late books
- Fine calculation
- Transaction rollback
- Stored function call
- Reports

---

**Final Submission Expected**

Participants should submit:

- Requirement understanding document
- Database design
- ER diagram
- Console application source code
- PostgreSQL scripts
- EF Core migration files
- Test cases
- Demo screenshots or output logs
